 # RELATIONAL DATABASE SERVICE CREATION IN AMAZON
## AIM
To Relational Database Service Creation in Amazon.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The experiment aims to demonstrate the creation of an Amazon RDS instance for hosting a relational database in the cloud. This includes configuring database settings, connecting to the instance, and testing database functionality using SQL commands.
